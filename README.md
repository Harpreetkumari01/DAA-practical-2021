# DAA-practical-2021
**The practical test contains 3 questions and 1 output pdf**
Questions 1.
Red black tree 
1.1 insertion of node

1.2 deletion of node

1.3 search the node and show its color

Red- black tree is the modification of other tree
While implementation the color of the nodes should be blanced
To make the red-black tree we need to follow some set of rules.
 
_If the program gives null pointer error then be sure to do compiler
 Its application is used in Linux kernel

Questions 2.
Minimum spanning tree of a graph using any greedy approach
(Kruskal algorithm)
* It builds the spanning tree by adding edges one by one into a growing spanning tree. Kruskal's algorithm follows 
greedy approach as in each iteration it finds an edge which has least weight and add it to the growing spanning tree.
 Its application is in design of network

Questions 3.
Implementation of different types of sorting like
Insertion, quick,merge, selection,bubble sort


**Tabular Comparison of all above sorting technique** 

|Sorting.      | best case| Worst case
|-----------   |----------|----------
|Insertion sort|  Ω(n)    |O(n^2)
|.             |.         |.  
|Merge sort.   |Ω(nlog(n))|O(n log(n))
|.             |.         |
|Bubble sort.  |Ω(n).     |O(n^2)
|.             |.         |
|quicksort.    |Ω(nlog(n))|O(n^2)
|.             |.         |
|Selectionsort.|  Ω(n^2)   | O(n^2)

_Note:- If time complexity is same we compare with space 
complexity_
